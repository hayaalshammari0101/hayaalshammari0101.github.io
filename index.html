        <div class="subheading mb-5">Biology B.S - Full Time Student</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Like an itch, the idea of wearing a white coat has always inspired my drive to study Biology. The mental image of my name tag reading, “Dr. Haya Al-Shammari” has been  etched in my mind. The passion began at the age of five when I was gifted a toy medical kit. Then, my childhood pretend play turned into an aspiration during a dermatologist visit in middle school; my provider was knowledgeable, empathetic, and confident and I wanted to be her. My free time began to focus on pimple popping and surgery videos, furthering my curiosity in the human body. 
Once in high school I was fortunate to be surrounded with many educational opportunities of which I have taken advantage. Each science class felt like I was one step closer to realizing my dream. I was thrilled to be chosen to take part in the two-year CTE program focused on kinesiology, patient, and healthcare. The coursework was enthralling, the ability to learn the different body systems to its movements, it offered more details to the picture of what treating patients would look like. The program even provided me with practical skills such as CPR and first aid certification, which I was then able to utilize in the Sports Medicine Program. Engaging in Sports Med for a two-year period has provided me with valuable hands-on experience allowing a glimpse into my desired future in Health Sciences. To more completely round out the image of what health science education brings, I founded the First Responders Club at school and volunteered at my local hospital assisting with patient care. Dipping my toes into these experiences has only increased my desire to have a deeper understanding of the body and ways to support it. 
At times my passion became so engrossing that it was detrimental to the time and energy I spent on other classes. While in the future I aim to create more of a balance, I will always prioritize what I am most passionate about. As the skeletal system frames the body, Health Sciences education will form the frame of my life.
<br><br>
        
         I place great emphasis on my education, aspiring to become the first in my family to go to college and emerge with a degree. However, enrolling in the classes that would increase the possibility of earning this position has brought its share of discouraging moments. Struggling with low grades, lacking personal support, and dealing with self-doubt were challenges to overcome. Enrolling in university, I anticipate my English skills will be tested. Even though I don't have a family member to guide, I'm ready to face these challenges on my own. As I am strongly inclined to shed the ESL label and to demonstrate that I am more than just a learner of English I will be overcoming a language barrier in similar ways I have been for the past years. I commit my time even outside the classroom by watching English cartoons. Later, I opted for progressively demanding English classes, leading to my final year in International-Baccalaureate English, only possible through my persistence in revising my writings into their highest potential and hours outside of class returning to work at my own pace to gain complete understanding of the content. The foreign language requirements presented an opportunity in my quest to further my understanding of English. Choosing American Sign Language incorporated a visual aspect to the learning process, allowing me to delve deeper into the subtleties and nuances of the language.  
<br><br>
    I hope to one day become a dermatologist. The drive to create a title for myself that will help others is what I will strive off to live a great life. I have passion to create opportunites for others and help others by treating their medical needs. Loving medicine isnt a hobby but it is a life style. 
My purpose has been embedded within me since I was a child, getting gifted toy medical kits for each birthday or watching surgery videos while I eat.
